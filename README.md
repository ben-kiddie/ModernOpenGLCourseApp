# ModernOpenGLCourseApp
Application created by accomplishing the uDemy course "Computer Graphics with Modern OpenGL and C++"

This course focused on creating and iterating upon an OpenGL application, introducing new features and techniques with each lecture while also exploring relevant theory. 

Topics covered include:
- How to create and manipulate windows,
- How to draw meshes and models, 
- How to use shaders,
- How to use uniforms,
- How to use GLM to transform models,
- How to use indexed draws,
- How to use projections,
- How to create and control a camera,
- How to map textures,
- How to use the Phong Lighting Model,
- How to implement Directional, Point and Spot Lights,
- How to import models,
- How to create and use Shadow Maps,
- How to implement a Skybox.

This application was developed through attending each lecture, developing a thorough understanding of the topic at hand, and implementing features accordingly - taking the application from basics...

This application will be used in other projects, such as a sandbox environment for testing other graphical features.
